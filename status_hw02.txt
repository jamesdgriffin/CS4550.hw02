Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
James Griffin

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
jimbot.io

3. What's the link to your repository on github with your code?
https://github.com/yono-oko/CS4550.hw02

4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?
I read through most of the tutorials for both and played around with the
'try it yourself' options they had there, which I found very helpful. Once
I reached the exercises, I felt that I was ready to move on to the homework.

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
I feel comfortable - the tutorials were helpful and were a very useful
reference when working on the homework. With the online resources available
and the amount of HTML and CSS I have learned in the last few days,
I expect to be fine with these languages.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
I did the first 5 - after that I felt I was ready to move on with the homework.

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
Fairly comfortable - I am still getting used to how some things work
(like Objects), but again the online documentation and tutorials are helping,
and I expect to keep getting more comfortable with JS.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)
Yes :)


9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had some trouble getting Event Listeners to work with my calculator, mostly
because I was not familiar with JS. It ended up coming down to a simple thing
missing that held me back for a long time - I neglected the need to wrap
the below buttonPress call in a function when creating the Event Listener:
document.getElementById("b7")
.addEventListener("click", function() {buttonPress("7")});
